<div class="info missing-inputs">
    <h2>You are almost finished...</h2>
    <p>Now you need to add some input elements. If you have already created one you can add it right now. Otherwise you have to go create one and come back to the form once you are done.</p>
    <p>For documentation on how to use the form, <a href="https://github.com/it-vegard/xp-form-builder/blob/master/README.md">visit the project home page</a></p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
